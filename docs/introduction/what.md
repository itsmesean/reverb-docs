title: What is reVerb?
---

reVerb is a VSCode extension for testing RESTful APIs

It parses through your express app, identifying and storing all [handler function](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) definitions and locations, giving you instant access to all known routes, so you can:
- Create requests with custom headers, cookies, url parameters and body
- See real-time responses and metrics
- Create and save custom presets specific to each route
- Generate [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) request functions for the front-end
- Display inline simple responses right in your editor

## Does reVerb replace Insomnia/Postman?

Something something apples to oranges...but no, reVerb is in the early stages of development and lacks many of the features found in Insomnia and Postman. Though, reVerbs core feature of automatic route identification and integration with VSCode is uniquely its own. Givin enough time and contributions from the communtiy it may just give the big dogs a run for their money...
